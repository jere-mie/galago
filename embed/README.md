# Created With Galago

Thanks for creating your website with [Galago](https://github.com/jere-mie/galago)!

## Getting Started

- Create new pages in the `pages/` directory
- Create new (non-rendered) templates in the `templates/` directory
- Store static assets in the `static/` directory
- Run `galago serve` to build your site to the `public/` directory and start a development server
- Run `galago` or `galago build` to build your site to the `public/` directory
- You can host your Galago site on any major hosting platform by simply serving the contents of the `public/` directory

Galago uses the Pongo2 templating engine to render templates. Consult [Pongo2's GitHub repository](https://github.com/flosch/pongo2) for more info on templating syntax. Pongo2 is very similar to [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/templates/language/) and [Flask/Jinja2's](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templating syntax.

Consult the official [Galago repository](https://github.com/jere-mie/galago) for more info.
